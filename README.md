# Axcel

A modular set of movement scripts to allow easy prototyping and further development for 2D platformers made on the Unity platform.

Originally created in Unity version 2021.1.17f1, and compatible with all versions using the same input system.

### **Usage**

Slap the AccelEngine on a gameobject, then either add a custom input manager, or the one provided in the example.
The engine script will automatically add a rigidbody2D component and a capsule collider if it cannot find one, so make sure this is placed on the root of your character.
Go in the modules folder, and drag and drop any modules you need, play with the sliders until you find the settings that you need.
There is no limit to how many modules you can add, and there is a blank template to create your own additional modules. (This will be used later in development for updates, so stay tuned)
